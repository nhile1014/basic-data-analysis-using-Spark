# Basic data analysis using Spark

Using Craft Brewery data to perform basic data analysis using Spark. The data includes three files:
  - beers.csv
  - breweries.csv
  - dictionary.doc

Then, I used Spark and related language such as SQL to answer some questions:
1.	Determine the number of breweries in each state
2.	Determine the cities with the most breweries
3.	Determine the most brewed beer style
